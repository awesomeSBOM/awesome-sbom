# What is SBOM (Software Bill Of Materials) ? 
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bill_of_materials):
> A software bill of materials (SBOM) is a list of components in a piece of software. Software vendors often create products by assembling open source and commercial software components. The SBOM describes the components in a product. It is analogous to a list of ingredients on food packaging: where you might consult a label to avoid foods that may cause an allergies, SBOMs can help companies avoid consumption of software that could harm their organization.
>
> The concept of a BOM is well-established in traditional manufacturing as part of supply chain management. A manufacturer uses a BOM to track the parts it uses to create a product. If defects are later found in a specific part, the BOM makes it easy to locate affected products.
